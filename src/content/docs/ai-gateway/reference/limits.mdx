<sup>1</sup> If you have reached 10 million logs stored per gateway, new logs
will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs in
that gateway to free up space or create a new gateway. This setting is useful
for maintaining continuous logging while staying within the default storage
constraints. Refer to [Auto Log
cleanup](/observability/logging/#auto-log-cleanup) for more details on how to
automatically delete logs.

<sup>2</sup> If you have reached 100,000 logs stored per account, across all
gateways, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must
delete older logs.

<sup>3</sup> Logs larger than 10 MB will not be stored.
